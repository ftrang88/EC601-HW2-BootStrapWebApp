# EC601-HW2-BootStrapWebApp
Boston University College of Engineering - EC601 HW2 - Create a Bootstrap Web Application

This is a project using a Bootstrap web application to display my resume.

Uses the Jumbotron template as base for site. Utilizes Google's Firebase to add chat feature, which can be logged into with authentiction by Google Account (and only Google Account). Chat is meant to be hosted locally using firebase serve functions. 

## HW5 - Test Cases

The "EC601 - Test Cases for HW2.xlsx" file contains a list of test cases and results.

**AWS Device Farm**: Information can be found in the 'AWS Device Farm' folder. Used HarishSChandra's [Android firebase chat app](https://github.com/harishschandra/HW_2.example.android.app) for testing. (instructions said if we used a webapp we could use our project teammate's app for this portion of the homework).
